Christoph Bodner is the Lead Data Scientist at the Austrian Postal Service. He is responsible for designing the data science architecture and for coding up predictive models. Prior to joining the Austrian Post, he worked as a financial consultant at KPMG.

Christoph holds a Master degree in Quantitative Finance and a Bachelor degree in Business. So he is neither scared by stuff like:
$$\max \left(\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 V''(x)+\mu V'(x)-rV(x), 1-V'(x) \right) = 0$$
nor bei acronyms such as GDPR, IFRS and EBITDA:)

His interests include traveling (he did a 9-month-trip-around-the-world), climbing and  playing board games. Recently he started teaching himself the piano.
