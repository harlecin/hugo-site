I switched from an old Apple Watch Series 3 model to a Garmin Epix 2 last December and I could not be happier with my choice. Battery life is amazing (I get 7+ days even with regular activity)
and I like all the fitness functionality that my Garmin brings with it out-of-the-box compared to the rather simplistic Apple Watch tracking you get by default.

Also, the OLED display of the Garmin Epix 2 is amazing and I like to use it for navigation while hiking and running. However, the Epix 2 without Saphire Display only comes with 16GB of 
storage, so when I saw that downloading the Garmin included maps each a large portion of that, I was looking for an alternative to only download the region/countries I actually need/use.

You can find excellent ready-to-use maps on [opentopomap.org](https://garmin.opentopomap.org/) 

They offer various different packages, such as a map containing the Alps or maps by countries

## Map Installation

Simply copy the *.img file you downloaded to the `/GARMIN/` folder on your Epix 2 and you are good to go :)

You can enable/disable the maps in settings.

## Navigating

Now that we have our maps, we also need a route to follow :)

There are two ways to start using route navigation on a Garmin Epix 2:

1. Use routes available in Garmin Connect app: Go to `More/Training & Planning/Courses`
2. Download .GPX routes and load them to your Garmin Watch using the Connect app

To start a following a route, you start a Hiking activity and got to `Navigate: Courses & More`. Here you can pick course that you sent to your watch using Garmin Connect. You can also select to follow the course in reverse.

Voil√°, and we are ready to enjoy routing on our Epix and still have plenty of storage left for music and apps.

Happy hiking!
