In the previous post I covered the basics you need to know to work with SQL Server. In this post, I want to show you some more advanced techniques that I found pretty helpful.

The topics I will cover include:

- How to speed up your queries with indices and using columnstore
- Introduction to working with stored procedures
- Creating functions
- Collaborating on a database project and version control

## Indices and columnstore
