Since R is mostly a functional language and data science work lends itself to be expressed in a functional form you can come by just fine without learning about object-oriented programming.

Personally, I mostly follow a functional programming style (although often not a pure one, i.e. w/o side-effects, because of limited RAM). Expressing mathematical concepts in a functional way is quite natural in my opinion.

However, object-oriented programming offers a lot of benefits in certain use cases. The Python data science community embraces oop, possibly because of its larger background in computer science as opposed to math/stats of the R community. While I think that oop is sometimes taken to far (I do not want to write `numpy.matmul(a, b)` to do matrix multiplication, I prefer `A %*% B`:), I also think that there is a lot to like about it. Oop helps to hide complexity, e.g. by encapsulating the complexity of a prediction algorithm.

In this post I want to show you how to use the S3 class system to load data from different sources into R and how to implement a class `myPredictionAlgorithm` with a `fit()` and `predict()` method using R6 as a class system.


## Object-oriented programming in R
As already mentioned, R has multiple systems to implement object-oriented programming. In order of complexity, starting from the simplest, they are:

1. S3 classes,
2. S4 classes,
3. Reference classes (~ R5) and 
4. R6 class system.

In contrast to 'classic' message-passing object-oriented languages like Python, C++ or Java, S3 uses so called generic-function oop. Message-passing oop involves sending messages (= methods) to an object, which then tries to find an appropriate function to call (Hadley Wickham, 'Advanced R'). S3 generic-function oop is actually quite similar to operator overloading. A *generic function* say, `print()`, decides which method to call, such as `print.myClass()`. S3 has no formal class definition. S4 and Reference Classes are more both more formal than S3. R6 is what most programmers coming from say Python expect an oo system to look like.

## S3 generics
A generic function is a function whose functionality depends on the object it is used on. `print()` is one of the best examples that shows the power of generic functions:
```{r}
# print for a vector:
print(1:10)
```

```{r}
# print for a data.frame:
print(mtcars)
```
Depending on the class of the input, `print()` returns a different output. 

Generic functions are also called *polymorphic functions*. When we inspect `print` we can see that it is indeed a S3-generic function:

```{r}
pryr::ftype(print)
```

Now, let's use the S3 class system to connect to a data source and extract some data. We start by building a connection class that we can pass to our extraction class to get some data:

```{r}
create_connection = function(connection_string, type) {
  class(connection_string) = type
  
  return(connection_string)
}
```

In S3 we can create a class simply by setting the `class` attribute. In our `create_connection()` function the class depends on the object type, which will be either 'local' or 'database'. Now we define a generic function `extract_data()` to load our data into R depending on the class of the connection object:

```{r}
# Note: extract() is the function name that dispatches to functions starting with extract.class
extract = function(object) UseMethod("extract")

# generic.class = function() ...
extract.local = function(connection_object) cat("Extracting data from local source ...\n")
extract.database = function(connection_object, getCols = NULL) cat("Extracting data from database ...\n")
# default if no class specific method is found
extract.default = function(connection_object) message("unknown connection object")
```

We define a generic function with `UseMethod()`. When we call `extract_data()`, our function checks the class attribute of the object we passed. Based on the class it searches for a function following the naming convention 'extract.class_name'. If it finds one, it will use it, else it will use our default implementation:

```{r}
con_local = create_connection("local connection", type = "local")
con_db = create_connection("database connection", type = "database")
con_spark = create_connection("spark connection", type = "spark")

# methods for class 'local' and 'database' are defined:
extract_data(con_local)
extract_data(con_db)

# there is no method for class 'spark':
extract_data(con_spark)
```

You could also rename our function `extract()` to `load()`, but the convention is to use the same name as in our call to 
UseMethod(). This allows you to easily find all specific implementations of the generic function using `methods()`:
```{r}
methods(extract)
```

We can also use `methods()` to list all methods implemented for a given class:
```{r}
methods(class = "local")
```

So essentially we created the following class hierarchy (adapted from: Thomas Mailund, Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in R):
```{r include = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../../static/img/class_hierarchy.png")
```

The abstract class 'extractData' defines an interface 'extract'. We do not explicitly create the abstract class, we only define its method `extract()` using a generic function. Using this generic function, we implement concrete classes called 'local', 'database' and 'default' by writing corresponding `extract.class` functions.

In the S3 class system inheritance works by specifying a character vector as class attribute like so:
```{r}
object = 1
class(object) = c("C", "B", "A")

class(object)
```

The first element in the class attribute vector is the most specialized and the last the most general.

## R6 
With a few notable exceptions (e.g. the `data.table` package) data is immutable in R. R6 is a class system that breaks the immutable-data principle by allowing mutable data structures. This allows us to create methods that actually modify objects and not make a copy. R6 can be seen as an improved version of the reference class system (R5), so I will not cover R5.

Let's try to build an R6 class for our prediction algorithm:
```{r}
library(R6)

myPredictionAlgorithm = R6Class("myPredictionAlgorithm",
                                private = list(
                                  model = NULL
                                  ),
                                public = list(
                                  formula = NULL,
                                  data = NULL,
                                  initialize = function(data = NA, formula = NA) {
                                    self$data = data
                                    self$formula = formula
                                    cat("model object created")
                                  },
                                  print = function() {
                                    print(paste0("Formula = ", c(self$formula)))
                                  },
                                  fit_lm = function(){
                                    private$model =lm(formula = self$formula, data = self$data)
                                    
                                    print(private$model)
                                  },
                                  get_coeff = function(){
                                    print(coefficients(private$model))
                                  }
                                )
                                )
```

To create an object of our class we call `$new()`, which will call `initialize()` if it exits:

```{r}
ols_model = myPredictionAlgorithm$new(data = mtcars, formula = mpg ~ cyl + carb)
```
Printing our model object gives us:
```{r}
ols_model
```
because we specified a custom-print function.

We can use `$` to get access to all public methods and values, like so:
```{r}
ols_model$fit_lm()
```

Or so:
```{r}
ols_model$get_coeff()
```

So, public members are accessed using `self$` and private members using `private$`. The R6 introduction vignette suggests to have methods return `invisible(self)`, if you want you want methods to be chainable. Private attributes can be accessed only by methods defined in the class or sub-classes.

Unfortunately, there is no way to enforce types of fields in R6 except by implementing checks manually (e.g. as a [checker class](https://github.com/r-lib/R6/issues/48#issuecomment-339872876)).
