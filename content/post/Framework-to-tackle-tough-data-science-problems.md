One of the things I particularly like about working in data science, is the science part: Figuring out the right questions to ask, how to frame a problem correctly and finally trying to solve it.

While there are many problems that you can simply solve by `library(caret)` or `from sklearn import *` and dumping your data into an appropriate algorithm those are usually just low-hanging fruits and not often not particularly interesting to work on either.

In this post, I want to show you the framework I developed (more correctly: which I am still developing) to help me solve interesting data science problems.

## Understanding the problem

This sounds like a no-brainer, but I fear it is still often underappreciated just how important it is. I have to make a concious effort 


## Getting to know your data
### Signal/Noise ratio

## Starting really simple
### Working with an easy sample
### A quick and dirty baseline

## Framing the problem in different ways

## Scaling your solution
