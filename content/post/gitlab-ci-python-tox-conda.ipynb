    "# Python Development with Gitlab CI and Tox\n",

    "While in R there is only one (admittedly sometimes limiting) way to structure a package, you have got quite a lot of options with in the Python world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since data science workloads rely heavily on the `conda` packaging ecosystem (especially on Windows machines), I will focus on how to make everything play nicely with `conda`.\n",

    "\n",
    "We begin setup by creating a new conda environment and specifying the interpreter we want to use and activating it:\n",

    "conda create --name <environment_name> python=3.8 -y\n",
    "conda activate <environment_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to setup our package structure. In R there is a function called `package.skeleton()` (or alternatively RStudio's GUI) that create a basic package with all necessary files. For Python there are different packages that provide similar functionality (such as `cookie-cutter`), but I will quickly outline a minimal setup here:\n",
