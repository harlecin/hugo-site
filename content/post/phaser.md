Notes to force me to finish this post today ^_^
I like to game, while I am not big on online games, LAN parties and retro games have a special place in my heart :) recently bought super mario wonders and it is wonderful :)
ray tracing blog post half finished for a long time...
never wanted to do javascript, but I have to say, new style and deno in particular are nice :)
deno + fresh was my goto choice to redo my blob, but alas, I could not get it to work yet with phaser...
so I switched to vite, which is really nice :)

Here is my setup, stay tuned for my first game :)
