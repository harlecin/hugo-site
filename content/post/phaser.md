In this post I want to discuss the a* algorithm (pronounced 'a-star'), how it is used for motion planning and how we can implement it in cpp.

The process of determining how to get from a start to an endpoint is called 'planning' and for a robot it's called 'robot motion planning'. There are two broad categories:

- discrete motion planning
- continuous motion planning
