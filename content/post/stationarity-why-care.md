Outline:
- What does it mean for a time series to be stationary?

    - weak vs strong stationarity
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process
    - Trend stationary vs difference stationary: https://www.mathworks.com/help/econ/trend-stationary-vs-difference-stationary.html
- why is important?

Primary reason: if x and y are not stationary, regressing them on one-another can lead to spurious relationships, except if they are cointegrated, e.g. they can be made stationary as a linear comb (y - beta x = i(0)), so the distance between them is constant
