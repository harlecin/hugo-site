Outline:
- Clustering = finding structure in data in an unsupervised fashion
- Transaction Data has various specific properties: high cardinality of categorical features, lots of data
- curse of dimensionality with euclidean distance (unit ball) -> jaccard distance
- ways to cluster transaction data using txmeans dataset
  - kmeans with jaccard, euclidean, txmeans, deep learning
