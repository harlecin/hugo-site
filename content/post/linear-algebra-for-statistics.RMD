Since quite some time has passed since I took my linear algebra courses, I thought I could comb through my old course notes and write a small post about linear algebra stuff that is quite useful to remember for statistics.

## Some useful Properties of Matrices

## Change of Basis

## Matrices as Linear Transformations
### Scaling
### Rotation
### Shearing
### Reflection
### Orthogonal Projection

## Positive Semi-Definite Matrices
### Covariance Matrix
