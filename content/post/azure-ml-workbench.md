A couple of notes before you go ahead an install the Workbench:
> MS warns that installation can take quite long (around 30min) and you should download the installer to disk and launch it from there and NOT from your browser widget!

I only saw the second warning after launching the installer from the browser and after about 10min it does indeed throw an error and the installation terminates, so that is that:) The installation does take quite long (I did not time it, but it feels like more than 30min), so be prepared to wait...

After the install is complete, you need to sign in with your Azure credentials. By default Workbench will choose the first(!) Experimentation account it finds in your subscription. You can change the Experimentation account afterwards though.
