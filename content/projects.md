Currently I am primarily working on the following projects:

- Setting up a scaleable low-cost cloud high-performance computing solution with AzureBatch and Docker
- Time series learning at scale by combining methods from statistics (state-space-models) with machine learning techniques (gradient boosting mostly)

I plan to put some more info up soon, so stay tuned:)

If *soon* turns out to be not so soon, feel free to open an issue on Github!
